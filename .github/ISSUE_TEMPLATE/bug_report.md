# Github Issues are not a Support or Discussion Forum

Before opening an issue, view the device's Console logs in the Scrypted Management web interface.

**DO NOT OPEN ISSUES FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:**

* Server or hardware setup assistance. Use Discord, Reddit, or Github Discussions.
* Feature Requests. Use Discord, Reddit, or Github Discussions.
* Packet loss in your camera logs. This is wifi/network congestion.
* HomeKit weirdness. See HomeKit troubleshooting guide.
* Release schedules or timelines. Releases are rolled out unevenly across the different server platforms.

However, if something **was working**, and is now **no longer working**, you may create a Github issue.
Created issues that do not meet these requirements or are improperly filled out will be immediately closed.
