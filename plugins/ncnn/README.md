# NCNN Object Detection for Scrypted

This plugin adds object detection capabilities to any camera in Scrypted. This plugin requires Vulkan capable hardware.

The NCNN Plugin should only be used if you are a Scrypted NVR user. It will provide no
benefits to HomeKit, which does its own detection processing.
