# Wyze Camera Plugin for Scrypted

This plugin must be installed inside a Scrypted Docker installation. Mac and Windows are not supported.

The Wyze plugin requires an [API Key](https://developer-api-console.wyze.com/#/apikey/view).

Wyze Cameras must still install a Motion Detection plugin for HomeKit Secure Video support. Scrypted NVR Users should use the accelerated WebAssembly Motion Detector. All other users may use OpenCV.
