# Motion Detection Plugin for Scrypted

The OpenCV Motion Detection Plugin adds motion detection to any camera.

Motion Detection should only be used if your camera does not have a plugin and does not provide motion
events via email or webhooks.


## Setup

1. Enable the integration on a camera.
2. Configure the motion area and threshold to change the sensitivity.
3. You test your setup in the camera's OpenCV Motion Detection settings, by enabling `Motion Detection Events` to see when motion is triggered.
